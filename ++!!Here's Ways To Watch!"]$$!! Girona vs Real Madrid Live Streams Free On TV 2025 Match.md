Real Madrid will look to return to winning ways in La Liga when they face Girona the Santiago Bernabéu on Sunday.

Kylian Mbappé delivered a masterclass in midweek, netting a hat-trick as Real Madrid secured a 3-1 victory over Manchester City, sealing a 6-3 aggregate win in the UEFA Champions League knockout playoff round.

However, Los Blancos will be slightly frustrated after being held to a 1-1 draw at Osasuna last weekend, a result that saw them slip behind Barcelona at the top of the table ahead of this weekend’s fixtures.

Meanwhile, Girona suffered a 2-1 defeat to Getafe on February 14, with Yangel Herrera scoring their only goal. The last meeting between these two sides saw Madrid claim a dominant 3-0 victory on December 7. Arda Guler, Jude Bellingham, and Mbappe each got on the scoresheet, while Girona struggled to break through, despite Yaser Asprilla leading the team with four shots.

Real Madrid vs. Girona lineups, team news
Jude Bellingham will be absent for Madrid’s next two La Liga matches due to suspension following a heated exchange with the referee. The Spanish giants are also without key defensive figures, as David Alaba, Éder Militão, and Dani Carvajal remain sidelined.

Real Madrid predicted XI (4-3-3, right to left): Courtois (GK) — Fede Valverde, Raul Asencio, Rudiger, Fran Garcia — Dani Ceballos, Modric, Camavinga — Rodrygo, Mbappe, Vinicius Junior.

Injured: David Alaba, Eder Militao, Dani Carvajal, Lucas Vazquez (questionable)
