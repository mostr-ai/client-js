ETIHAD STADIUM, MANCHESTER â€” Manchester City host Liverpool in Sunday's big Premier League match.

Pep Guardiola's side suffered a demoralising UEFA Champions League exit at the hands of Real Madrid this week, and the focus now will be on ensuring they qualify for next season's tournament, with their domestic title defence effectively over.

Liverpool are top of the standings and favourites to usurp City's position as Premier League champions, but the Reds' form has tailed off a little in 2025. The draw with Aston Villa on Wednesday was not a bad result in isolation, but it did give some hope to Arsenal in the title race.

Man City vs. Liverpool live updates, highlights, and commentary
50 mins before kickoff: More by accident than design, we're about to witness one of the legacies of this rivalry. There is no out-and-out centre-forward in either starting XI, with Darwin Nunez on the Liverpool bench and Erling Haaland out injured. Pep Guardiola is most heavily associated with false nine tactics, which of course were championed by his mentor and Arne Slot's compatriot Johan Cruyff. Jurgen Klopp's centre-forward of choice was master link man Roberto Firmino and the alternative ways each team found to rack up goals was truly captivating. There's some irony that it's now City who look most lost without a conventional No. 9, such is Haaland's influence. They badly missed him in Madrid in midweek.

1 hr 10 mins before kickoff: And this is what things look like for the league leaders. We'll assume Curtis Jones is going to supplement the front three on the left but Slot could always opt for an extra man in midfield to counter City's possession-hogging tendencies. That said, he'd probably have been expecting more than one controlling midfielder in the City line-up.

1 hr 15 mins before kickoff: Here are the teams. No Haaland once again for City and Guardiola appears to be trying to account for that shortfall with a far more attacking line-up than the one he put out in Madrid. Kevin De Bruyne and Jeremy Doku are each in from the start alongside Phil Foden, Savinho and Omar Marmoush. Rico Lewis returns at right-back, with Abukodir Khusanov shuffling over to centre-back alongside Nathan Ake. Ruben Dias only makes the bench.

1 hr 30 mins before kickoff: Although their head-to-head tussles during the Klopp-Guardiola era often came with the title on the line, City and Liverpool do have experience of playing one another in recent seasons with one in and one out of the title race. In April 2023, City came from a goal down without Erling Haaland â€” a predicament they might have to revisit today â€” to ransack a Reds' team that failed to qualify for the Champions League. A Liverpool victory today would hurt City in that respect, while also being a huge step towards the title following Arsenal's defeat to West Ham yesterday.

2 hours before kickoff: This might not be the meeting of two title contenders that we've come to expect, but Man City vs. Liverpool very rarely disappoints and this one could be a thriller.
